<span style="font-weight:bold; word-spacing:0.11em;">GlanceNet v3</span>

<div> <span style="word-spacing:0.05em;">Developerâ€™s words</span> </div>
<br>

<div>
    <span style="word-spacing:0.05em;">GlanceNet was created to easily check Packet information such as transaction errors, transmission time, and data errors during client and server development.</span>
</div>
<br>

<div>
    <span>In order to find data errors during CS development, it was essential to modify the client or server code (code that leaves dumps or logs), and after finding the error, the code had to be returned to its original state. Alternatively, you can use a sniffer tool such as tcpdump on Linux or WireShark on Windows to check the data, but there are too many dumps, complex filter settings to find the necessary data, and efforts to convert the data into the desired value form. It took a lot of time and effort.</span>
    <span>In the end, I made GlanceNet to easily and simply check data on the network.</span>
</div>
<br>

<div>
    <span>I made it by myself and used it, but at the request of a developer I know, GlanceNet was released for other developers to debug easily and conveniently.</span>
    <span>There are many shortcomings because I use it alone. As long as time and funds allow, we will continue to update in the future.</span>
</div>
<br>

<div> <span>GlanceNet is distributed as Freeware. (GlanceNet is supported starting from Windows 10.)</span> </div>
